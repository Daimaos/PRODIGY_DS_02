# ðŸš¢ Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview  
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to understand the characteristics and patterns within the dataset that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

---

## Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) competition on Kaggle. It contains passenger information including demographics, ticket details, and survival status.

## Project Tasks  
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and analyzing key features such as Passenger Class, Gender, Age, Fare, and their relationships with survival.  
- Visualization: Creating bar charts, histograms, count plots, heatmaps, and more to identify trends and patterns.

## Key Insights  
- Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.  
- Passengers in first class had better chances of survival.  
- Age and fare distributions showed meaningful trends related to survival.  
- Correlation analysis highlighted important numerical relationships.
